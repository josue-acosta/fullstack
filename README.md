Hello and welcome. My name is Josue and I'd like to present my web app called [Mi Systema](www.josue-acosta.app).

This is a demo site where names, prices, and messages are made up. And where you're encouraged to play around and create a cake order and try out the text-to-webchat converation feature.

To convert this site to a demo I removed the authorization needed to visit the internal section. Which means you'll see some commented lines of code to show where and how I would implement them. You can tell them apart with the Demo tag (`[ DEMO ]`) and the end of the comment. Please refer to the `feature/channel-twilio` branch for the source code.

This is part of my portfolio so if you have questions you can find out more here: www.josue-acosta.com
